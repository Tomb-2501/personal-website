    intro: `A non-profit organisation dedicated to engaging the public with science through hands-on, interactive experiences.`,
    date: `January 2016 - July 2022`,
    content1: `It was here that I started to understand how to work with wood, plastic and metal.  I learned how to TIG weld and
     work with stainless steel.  I learned Solidworks during Covid and ended up designing and fabricating the furniture for
      a whole exhibition.`,

    date: `August 2022 - October 2024`,
    content1: `At Artem SFX I honed my skills as a welder, fabricator and machinist, and ended up writing a user manual for the CNC lathe so that I could teach others.
      I became a coded welder for TIG welding aluminium and steel.  On first arrival, I was put to work making the steel frames for a piano for Adele's Vegas residency.
        Later on, I was part of the core team for the prototyping and production of props for Stranger Things: The First Shadow.  `,
    content2: `I met some incredible people working here, and while I was teaching others some of the skills I had picked up along the way, I took every opportunity to 
    learn as much as could from the wealth of knowledge that some of my colleagues possessed. I was also one of the workshop's first aiders, which came into use more than once.`,
